c28a355b-826a-4a46-bf48-92064fc4b1ae	the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, alone or in combination, appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix

43cbe217-d0e3-4f85-be35-aad0350c6d6b	dr. vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the u.s. after lung cancer
52bc1ad9-3031-412e-a743-04da8f219cc9	he believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple "hits" on cancer suppressor genes, because it often seems to develop in stages
fa258ae2-4d90-4412-83df-a58a8910904d	if both copies of a second gene were then deleted, the polyps would progress to malignancy
6b4a716e-588e-486b-918f-eb909895b835	it was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop

40db6da6-0334-4732-9027-0ce411981201	researchers in edinburgh, scotland, have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies
4180ea01-0233-4c72-9bc3-ac53a05c62af	that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families, the gene, when inherited in a damaged form, may predispose women to the cancer

ead3187a-c01c-447e-a82f-e4b60e47756d	when you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives, including, i might say, the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted, so that they create a market for themselves
b48bfa45-58bc-4646-acd5-8ba4a37842c7	they won't have that incentive because they won't have that market

7ce1b078-79e0-4be6-87e4-49d5fcdbea09	that, at least at the federal level, political "ticket splitting" has been on the rise over the past half century
c88c3382-e743-4525-9f83-7faa18417c47	in only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the white house than for the house of representatives.
430cc58c-6f14-464f-9136-2469c80464a2	as we know, voters tend to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress
290eb479-ede5-41bb-b330-2b56ef5c1ab0	in every presidential election over the past half century, except for the goldwater presidential candidacy, the gop has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for congress
4b2fd70c-bd3d-4ef7-ac7f-107713532fe4	if these assumptions hold, voters in races for congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean democratic
9b352ffd-febc-4a8d-9bba-00a90955969d	if they put a republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies
c5fca737-c412-4e94-8622-d750a4276e4d	second, it explains why voters hold congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives
7b012ad5-7307-48b8-bc02-e78a64699ac3	any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
23602cc5-3a93-4cd3-a4f1-a88187ea8481	the one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman republicans brought into office in 1980 by the reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982
465df127-8245-46fa-8b94-23893fbc4b2d	because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the reagan revolution -- in national policy making, they were more vulnerable to defeat
421f432a-b944-4b33-9d0c-d35615b20b13	fourth, the theory indicates why the republican party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office
e4734d9a-131b-4e09-9a8a-63ab6d15ad78	potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent
66376d9b-7825-4dd2-9dee-6f8b2ebd80b4	fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the south
884c7fc6-5131-46b2-8094-e80c583c0c4a	to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a disproportionate share of power in congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the south have had an especially strong incentive to keep such democrats in office
36645d61-393a-4912-b2e8-46fa937c016f	finally, the theory suggests why republicans generally have fared better in senate races than in campaigns for the house
3132cc2e-4714-44ae-b7f4-1eadc311d184	since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their democratic counterparts
2cadb402-102c-4b16-b18b-c23129d7d374	this is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the house
da303d62-235b-4e95-b8a7-ab16be9a7ff4	the democratic house attendance rate has not exceeded the republican house attendance rate since 1959
ce934235-55b3-44ec-9cad-681230b9a968	moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level
3ce4b71d-f960-4f4c-ac31-d107268e209a	state government is more typically split along republican-governor/democratic-legislature lines than the reverse
