cefa1e81-e76a-41f0-bc85-d7f0620ffb60	So far, Nissan's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential

c27a80dd-65b1-402c-ac39-76ffea076faa	In its last fiscal year, Nissan's profit represented just 2.3% of sales, compared with 4.3% at Toyota

b28c333e-4b27-444c-b782-f769f809d24c	Over the past decade or two the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products, variations on products, and variations on the variations
57996d8b-7a27-4d96-bf7b-bb211144c58c	Besides term life and whole life (the old standbys), we now have universal life, universal variable life, flexible adjustable universal life, policies with persistency bonuses, policies festooned with exotic riders, living benefit policies, and on and on
315316f1-ad8f-4064-ad6a-218d8b0ebf2e	First, generalize
af64357c-51fa-4374-b288-37237f9321cf	Shorn of all their riders, special provisions, and other bells and whistles, insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories: so-called pure insurance, which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death, and permanent insurance, which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive
29a15a95-a7be-4086-bf8c-fab28afec043	If all you want is death-benefit coverage, pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck, within limits
4077ecf7-fcf7-4b28-89fa-eaa6b9da7d0b	It's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age
1a2a588f-61ba-41be-a002-be7c186f4bec	But "term" means just that
d399454e-18c5-4b2b-ba66-76eebbd4e424	the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires
7947d161-180a-47c9-9719-4b404aac0418	if you flunk you may not be able to buy it
6515bdb7-72bc-411d-9d1c-53dd934d4f5f	Even if you're healthy and can renew, your premium will go up sharply because you're that much older

fd4b07fd-2e6a-41e6-98ae-9937598145c5	And in most cases, a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is, in effect, paying the salesman's commission as well
f220ba0e-2afb-434c-bed5-96be7bd722fc	investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years, largely because of this
9acbc205-6775-4c3b-8e29-71582b6b4d6c	The simplest, most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy
af738613-850d-4caf-99e8-e849a49888a6	You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage, the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing, and your cash value and dividends grow over the years
06ce7fee-fc57-45f0-8ef2-c171f8eb8ad1	Hugely popular, it is far more flexible than straight whole life
abdafda5-732b-4f70-b2b9-f3e75bf29d4d	I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment
665fe1b9-395c-4f95-af0d-31e9fa575e31	I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment
aaac6c20-159c-4825-8c9b-71bc335b938b	I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year
bcde5dcc-a9a4-41b0-baf4-15a69b7b0da6	So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection
c1ab11c1-cd43-4116-9e06-8f5de4f32087	these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I'm still alive

d28c7f80-54af-447a-a544-09f718458f1f	I compared one universal policy for $130,000 face amount from such an insurer, American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln, Neb., with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen
fd238e1e-e2fc-43f6-8d0f-b52b2b6b016e	After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $792, but Id get only $14 from the Equitable
a8403eea-031d-492d-b947-3ccbeac375c9	The difference is magnified by time, too
718ac367-6b44-481e-bca4-96ffe6ebc082	At age 65, when I'd stop paying premiums, the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $14,000 higher than the other, even though the Equitable's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate

bf6e96ca-0050-4408-b7f4-d5bbd8d8f874	In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.
fc1a5e29-531e-4650-84b7-231b38479095	As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress
777686d4-6fbb-4bc3-8f4b-c36ebb9ec012	In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress
20b936d6-bca7-4861-b375-67838e56500f	If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Democratic
1c4f7b93-2591-4b57-9582-88fe8b4db58c	If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies
b7b469a9-58fb-48bd-96e4-1015f9381016	Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives
1b2c1ab1-80ac-4e74-9ca5-9c8ed36af522	Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
e6fd9f6c-1c1c-4db5-b18f-cb8aea36573a	The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982

cbc85b0e-a15c-4411-86b7-d23da745bd78	Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office
42d03ac2-e044-4471-9b45-d1c0134d4666	Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent
a755450d-7853-473d-89af-f14832f67000	Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South
f6a76313-3137-4cfd-a8c3-0fe8ce81e865	To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office
aeed3b81-ddef-4890-9173-d283f3adb492	Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House
eda27d70-1b83-4aed-b10e-3ba60f109041	Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts
1e17b204-02d6-47ae-b3af-6cecef469489	This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House
